seeclickfix.py: Python code for training/predicting SeeClickFix data

DESCRIPTION:
The SeeClickPredictFix contest goal was to predict the number of votes,
views, and comments that an "issue" submitted to the 311 service of
four cities in the US will receive, with evaluation based on RMSLE.

The various functions in seeclickfix.py have description docstrings,
but briefly, their main use is to generate sparse matrices from the data
such as a word count matrix from the "description" field of training set.
The tables generated can be used in various models but I include one
simple version that uses Naive Bayes.

The code is intended for interactive use, but also included is a function
main() that will take the training and test data and generate predictions
that can be submitted to Kaggle.  See the docstring of main() for more
details.  To generate these predictions, uncomment the following lines
at the end of seeclickfix.py, then run the file from the command line:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
